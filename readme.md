# Astropy Report 

This report was created as part of a project to support the newly hired community manager at Astropy in late 2023. 
Details of that contract, supported by a grant from the Moore Foundation [are in this GitHub Issue](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/issues/310#issuecomment-1677899854)

While this report is largely done, we welcome issues that identify typos, or comments and suggestions for future work, either with Astropy or with other organizatinos.  

If you'd like to have Organizatinoal Mycology do similar work with you, get in touch with us via email (info at orgmycology dot com).
